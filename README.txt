AVL Tree Visualizer

This project is a web-based visualization of an **AVL Tree**, implemented using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to insert values into an AVL Tree and visually observe how the tree balances itself using rotations.

What is an AVL Tree?
An AVL Tree is a **self-balancing Binary Search Tree** where the height difference (balance factor) between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most **1**.

To maintain balance, the AVL Tree performs the following rotations:
- LL (Left-Left)
- RR (Right-Right)
- LR (Left-Right)
- RL (Right-Left)
